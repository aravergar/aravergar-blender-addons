# Changelog for Animation Batch Baking

* **v1.0 [27-3-16]** - Fully functional script. Bakes all the actions of the model and store the result in actions with the same name.
* **v1.1 [31-3-16]** - Fixed a bug in which the script didn't bake the actions separately. Edited for compatibility with mounts.

## TODO

* Look for a way of integrating *Simplify Multiple F-Curves* within this script.

* Look for ways of exporting the result aside from the current savefile.
