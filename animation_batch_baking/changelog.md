# Changelog for Animation Batch Baking

* **v1.0 [27-3-16]** - Fully functional script. Bakes all the actions of the model and store the result in actions with the same name.

## TODO

* Look for an optimizer addon for the fcurves and integrate it within this script.

* Look for ways of exporting the result aside from the current savefile.
